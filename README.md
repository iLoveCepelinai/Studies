# Studies
## Introduction
This repository is for tasks that I had to complete as a "Data Science" student during my bachelor's degree (2019-2023 (still ongoing)) in Vilnius University. These projects represent the minimum of what I can do. Most of the semesters will be seperated into branches, there you will find folders with subjects that I had during that semester.
## Warning
Most of the projects are in Lithuanian language. I will translate all the names of the subjects in **readme** files of each semester branch.
