# Fourth semester
This semester features more projects. One of them is "Algorithm theory" which is oriented in finding fastest algorithms. Since I had to create a new repo for that course, I will link it below:
* [Algorith theory](https://github.com/iLoveCepelinai/Algoritmu-teorija)
Other courses that I had are:
* Duomenų vizualizacija - data visualisation
* Imčių metodai - sampling methods
* Statistinis modeliavimas - statistical modelling
* Parametrinė statistika - Parametric statistics
