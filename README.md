# Third semester
In this semester I only had one practical course (Object-Oriented Programming) which has it's own multiple repositories (begins with "objektinis.."). This course features only C++ code, app creation and some optimization. Below are links to relavant repos:
* [First part](https://github.com/iLoveCepelinai/Objektinis_programavimas)
* [Second part](https://github.com/iLoveCepelinai/Objektinis_2dalis)
* [Third part](https://github.com/iLoveCepelinai/Objektinis_3dalis)
* [Exam](https://github.com/iLoveCepelinai/ObjektinioEgz)
