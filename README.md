# Fifth Semester
This semester was the most practical so far, introducing me better Big Data processing methods, AI basics and linear models. This semester is mostly work with R and Python, some SAS. Below are courses I had during fifth semester:
* DI pagrindai - AI basics;
* Didziuju duomenu programiniai irankiai - Big Data analysis tools;
* Tiesiniai modeliai - Linear models;
* Neparametrine statistika - Non-parametric statistics;
* Duomenu tvarkyba su R - Data management with R.

## About Big Data analysis tools
This was a project to test our capability to work with parallel programming, Linux Bash and Python. I made a cross-validation method using multiple computer cores. This knowledge is usefull since now I can encorporate parallel programming into my own work in order to speed up calculations.

## Linear models
This subject gave me a good understanding of regression analysis. This topic built a foundation of my regression, classification, predictions knowledge.

Some of my proudest works in this semester are:
* [Image classification](https://github.com/iLoveCepelinai/Studies/blob/Fifth-semester/DI%20pagrindai/Uzduotis4/uzduotis4.ipynb)


Data management I apply:
