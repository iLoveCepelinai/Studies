This semester was the most practical so far, introducing me better Big Data processing methods, AI basics and linear models. This semester is mostly work with R and Python, some SAS. Below are courses I had during fifth semester:
* DI pagrindai - AI basics;
* Didziuju duomenu programiniai irankiai - Big Data analysis tools;
* Tiesiniai modeliai - Linear models;
* Neparametrine statistika - Non-parametric statistics;
* Duomenu tvarkyba su R - Data management with R.
