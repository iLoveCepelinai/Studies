# Studies
## Introduction
This repository is for tasks that I had to complete as a "Data Science" student during my bachelor's degree (2019-2023 (still ongoing)) in Vilnius University. These projects represent the minimum of what I can do. Most of the semesters will be seperated into branches, there you will find folders with subjects that I had during that semester.
## What to do?
Click on a button with text *main* on it. You will see all semesters that I have uploaded, click on one that interests you. There you will see folders with my work, some translations and explanations. Further semesters have more data.
## Disclaimer
Most of the projects are in Lithuanian language. I will translate all names of the subjects in **readme** files of each semester branch.
