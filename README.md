# Sixth Semester
This was the most recent semester I had. One of the main subject was writing of scientific work. This was a preperation of bachelor's thesis which is coming up on eigth semester. The main reason why this was easier is because we were able to do this in pairs, so the work is not only going to be mine, but a colaboration with Antanas U. It is by far the most polished work I have contributed to, although not the most difficult (due to deadline of a whole semester, only one model that we explored (LR)).
